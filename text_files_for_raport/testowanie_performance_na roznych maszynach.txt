testing where the performance issue is:

1. send from server to gui - shit

2. send from server to werl on my laptop - ok, speed ok
3. send from server to werl on other laptop - ok, speed ok

these two tests were without stomp adapter plugin - that means using pure amqp
publish and receive rates are almost identical, so the porblem must be somwhere in js (websockets etc) or in stomp adapter in rabbitmq
stomp is built upon tcp - which slows down the connection because all the ack's that have to be sent back (from browser's running client to stomp plugin in rabbitmq)
